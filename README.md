With what's going on in Matt Mullenweg's head, it's time to kick out wordpress.org for a new API!


- domain.com replace wordpress.org
- api.domain.com replace api.wordpress.org
- wordpress-develop replace the wordpress installation. (For now We push only what we edit, but the full installation will come.)
